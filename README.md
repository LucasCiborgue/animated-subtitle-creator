Hello World!!!

I made this utilitary program for my youtube channel
https://www.youtube.com/@CibasKnight

It takes text and transforms it into animated subtitles

HOW TO INSTALL:
1) download the zip folder
2) install ffmpeg on your system
3) put ffpmeg on your PATH
4) decompress the zip folder
5) edit the .bat file
6) change the python address to your pc's python .exe address
7) change the app address to your current "text_editor_app.py" address

DONE!

TO USE:
1) Select your presets or select your colors (the 06 buttons bellow the text edit)
2) write something on the text edit
  2.1) "Enter" will generate a new subtitle
   2.2) writing "\n" will generate a multiline subtitle
3) press one of the right side buttons,

DONE! 
That will generate as much animated subtitles as the ammount of lines you wrote!
